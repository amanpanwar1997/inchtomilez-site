// All admin features use localStorage:

✅ Blog Posts       → localStorage ('admin_blog_posts')
✅ Theme Settings   → localStorage ('admin_theme_settings')
✅ Website Settings → localStorage ('admin_website_settings')
✅ SEO Settings     → localStorage ('admin_seo_settings')
✅ Users           → localStorage ('admin_users')
✅ Analytics       → localStorage ('admin_analytics')
✅ Backups         → localStorage ('admin_backups')
```

## 🚀 **WHAT'S FUNCTIONAL NOW:**

| Feature | Status | How It Works |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Create Blog Posts** | ✅ Working | Save to localStorage |
| **Edit Posts** | ✅ Working | Update localStorage |

## 💡 **SIMPLE USAGE:**

// Create blog post
const post = {
  id: 'post-1',
  title: 'My First Post',
  content: 'Hello world!',
  status: 'published',
  // ... other fields
};

saveBlogPost(post);  // Saves to localStorage ✅
```

### **On Website:**
```typescript
import { getAllBlogPosts } from '../utils/admin/adminStorage';

function BlogsPage() {
  const posts = getAllBlogPosts();  // Get from localStorage ✅
  
  return (
    <div>
      {posts.map(post => (
        <BlogCard key={post.id} post={post} />
      ))}
